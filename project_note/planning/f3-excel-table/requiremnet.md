static excel table read in , and for each row, put on the web page static area according to headers
in the user input page, allow for user to click, select options, and input text, via a large drop down list or pop up window or canvas. there will be some rules for which option will affect the showing of text in other boxes. they will put everything into an excel file. currently i won't consider dynamic change from their side. let me check and ask them in the future. 
there needs to be a data export from these user filled tables
on the page, i mentioned some parts will change when user selected an option in other parts,so there will be a rule from them on how those should change. you need to put the rules in the page


So this is the excel they will upload, and the system would need to read from each row as auto filled information: 航空安全事件示例.xlsx

There is a comprehensive map of what to put in each manual / auto filled/ rule options in this web page: 标签汇总.xlsx. More context: This one got all the information but they are a bit convoluted . so just ask me when you can't find the corresponding information 


so the things to do are:
design a static page for user to selection options based on the layout design. 
fill each block with options from the label-summary excel. 
store and allow for output of the labeled information 
allow for uploading of a excel file with the 航空安全事件示例.xlsx headers


5. so for each row, create a annotation task for it. and present the same static page for them to fill in the information. 

6. remember the rules for auto display? the rule-based auto display will be reflected in this part the green part with red highlight box image-1.png
so each row, is determined by the option selection from the options from the same row
 
the rules are pretty simple from what I can see, basically, it's like, if you choose option A from the left most column, the value will turn to "AAA". something like that 
 
i think the frustrating thing here is with matching the words and finding the options to be display for them to select from 
 
just ask me if you can't find the corresponding information
 
I put some detailed guide in the ppt file 
 
the label summary page are just the options you need to display. and store the options as the annotation outputs
